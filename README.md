# SEO-Checklist-for-Start-up
This project focuses on identifying and prioritizing SEO issues on Chillomania's website using an SEO checklist template. The primary goal is to evaluate if all essential SEO principles have been correctly implemented, ensuring the best possible foundation for future website optimization.

Project Overview

Scenario

Chillomania provided the first draft of their website and requested a thorough SEO review. The purpose of this audit is to ensure that all critical SEO elements have been appropriately applied by the developers in the initial version of the website.


Objective

The objective of this project is to use a custom SEO checklist template to evaluate the SEO status of Chillomania’s draft website, identify missing or poorly implemented SEO elements, and provide recommendations for improvement based on prioritized findings.


Tasks Undertaken

1. Preparation of the SEO Checklist
Made a copy of a pre-designed SEO Checklist Template tailored to evaluate key SEO principles, including:

On-Page SEO: Title tags, meta descriptions, headings, content optimization, image alt text, URL structure, etc.

Technical SEO: Mobile responsiveness, page speed, crawlability, secure HTTPS, etc.

Off-Page SEO Readiness: Potential for backlinks, social signal integration, etc.

2. Website Evaluation
Used the SEO checklist to review each item against the first draft of Chillomania's website.
Recorded findings directly on the checklist, marking items as:

Implemented correctly
Partially implemented
Not implemented
Not applicable (if features are not present in the draft version)

3. Identification of SEO Issues
Identified gaps or areas of improvement in Chillomania’s SEO implementation (e.g., missing meta tags, slow page loading speed, poor keyword optimization).
Assessed these issues based on their impact on SEO performance, factoring in elements like search engine visibility, user experience, and ranking potential.

4. Prioritization of Issues
Categorized issues based on their severity and urgency:

Critical: Issues that need immediate attention and significantly affect SEO performance (e.g., missing title tags, broken links).

High Impact: Issues that have a noticeable impact on the website's SEO ranking (e.g., lack of keyword optimization, uncompressed images).

Low Impact: Minor fixes that enhance performance or user experience but are not urgent (e.g., enhancing internal linking).
Deliverables

Completed SEO Checklist Document: Contains detailed observations for each SEO criterion and its implementation status.
Issue Prioritization Report: Summarized analysis of the identified issues and their prioritization, guiding the development team on what to address first.

Recommendations: Practical and actionable steps to fix the identified issues and improve SEO performance.
Technologies and Tools Used

SEO Tools: Google Keyword Planner, Google PageSpeed Insights, MOZ Bar, and Ubersuggest for keyword research, competition analysis, and page optimization insights.
